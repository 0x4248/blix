# Blix

Blix is a anthropomorphic fox which is my fursona (yes im a furry). Blix is a blue, white and black fox. His name comes from several things. The `Bl` part comes from the main colour of his fur which is blue. The `x` at the end comes from the second character from my username `0x4248`.

## Blix's other names
